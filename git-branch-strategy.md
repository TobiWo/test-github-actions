# Git Branch Strategy for Semantic-Release Workflow

This documentation outlines the git branching strategy optimized for semantic-release automation and small team/solo development.

## Branch Structure Overview

### Persistent Branches

- **`main`** - Production releases, protected branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for ongoing development

### Temporary Branches

- **`release-vX.Y.Z`** - Release preparation, deleted after merge
- **`feature/*`** - Individual features, deleted after merge to develop

## Workflow Strategy Summary

| Transition | Method | Reason |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Feature ‚Üí Develop** | Direct merge | Fast iteration for small teams |
| **Develop ‚Üí Release** | Cherry-picking | Selective commit inclusion |
| **Release ‚Üí Main** | Pull Request | Approval gate + semantic-release trigger |

## Detailed Workflows

### 1. Feature Development

```bash
# Create and develop feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
# ... make changes ...
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"

# Merge to develop (direct merge for speed)
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/user-authentication
git commit -m "feat(user-authentication): [describe the changes]"
git push origin develop

# Cleanup feature branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
git push origin --delete feature/user-authentication
```

### 2. Release Preparation (Cherry-Picking)

```bash
# Create fresh release branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release-v1.2.0

# View available commits in develop
git log develop --oneline --graph

# Cherry-pick specific commits for release
git cherry-pick abc1234  # User authentication feature
git cherry-pick def5678  # Password reset feature
git cherry-pick ghi9012  # Critical bug fix
# Skip experimental features not ready for release

# Push release branch
git push origin release-v1.2.0
```

**Why Cherry-Picking over Full Merge:**

- ‚úÖ **Selective releases** - Choose exactly which features to include
- ‚úÖ **Quality control** - Exclude work-in-progress or experimental code
- ‚úÖ **Clean history** - No merge commits cluttering release branch
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Can include commits from multiple feature branches

### 3. Release Execution

```bash
# Create Pull Request: release-v1.2.0 ‚Üí main
# This can be done via GitHub UI or CLI:
gh pr create --base main --head release-v1.2.0 \
  --title "Release v1.2.0" \
  --body "## Release v1.2.0

### Features Included:
- User authentication (abc1234)
- Password reset functionality (def5678)  
- Critical login bug fix (ghi9012)

### Testing:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Security review completed"

# After PR approval and merge:
# - Semantic-release automatically runs
# - Version tag created
# - GitHub release published
# - Contributors notified
```

### 4. Post-Release Cleanup

```bash
# After release PR is merged to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Sync develop with released changes
git checkout develop  
git rebase main  # Include any release-specific fixes
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release-v1.2.0
git push origin --delete release-v1.2.0
```

## Branch Lifecycle Management

### Persistent Branches (Never Delete)

- **`main`** - Always keep, production history
- **`develop`** - Always keep, continuous integration point

### Temporary Branches (Delete After Use)

- **`release-vX.Y.Z`** - Delete after successful merge to main
- **`feature/*`** - Delete after merge to develop

### Release Branch Naming

```bash
# Recommended naming convention:
release-v1.2.0    # Major.Minor.Patch
release-v2.0.0    # Major version
release-hotfix    # Emergency fixes
```

## Complete Release Cycle Example

```bash
# === DEVELOPMENT PHASE ===
# Feature 1
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/login
# ... develop ...
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/login
git commit -m "feat(login): [describe the changes]"
git branch -d feature/login
git push origin develop

# Feature 2  
git checkout -b feature/dashboard
# ... develop ...
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/dashboard
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): [describe the changes]"
git branch -d feature/dashboard
git push origin develop

# === RELEASE PHASE ===
# Prepare release
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b release-v1.2.0

# Select commits for release
git log develop --oneline  # Review available commits
git cherry-pick abc123     # Include login feature
git cherry-pick def456     # Include dashboard feature
# Skip xyz789 (experimental feature not ready)

git push origin release-v1.2.0

# Create PR: release-v1.2.0 ‚Üí main
# After merge (triggers semantic-release):

# === CLEANUP PHASE ===
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout develop && git merge main
git push origin develop
git branch -d release-v1.2.0
git push origin --delete release-v1.2.0

# === CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT ===
git checkout -b feature/next-feature
# ... cycle continues ...
```

## Team-Size Specific Recommendations

### Small Team / Solo Development (Recommended)

```bash
# Fast iteration workflow
Feature ‚Üí Develop: Direct merge (no PR overhead)
Develop ‚Üí Release: Cherry-pick (selective releases)
Release ‚Üí Main: Pull Request (approval + semantic-release)
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **Speed** - Minimal overhead for feature integration
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Easy to experiment and iterate
- ‚úÖ **Quality gate** - Final approval on releases
- ‚úÖ **Automation** - Semantic-release handles versioning

### Larger Teams

```bash
# Code review workflow  
Feature ‚Üí Develop: Pull Request (code review)
Develop ‚Üí Release: Cherry-pick (selective releases)
Release ‚Üí Main: Pull Request (release approval)
```

**Additional considerations:**

- Branch protection rules on `develop`
- Required reviewers for feature PRs
- Automated testing on all branches

## Cherry-Picking Best Practices

### Selecting Commits for Release

```bash
# Good commits to include:
‚úÖ Completed features
‚úÖ Bug fixes  
‚úÖ Performance improvements
‚úÖ Security updates
‚úÖ Documentation updates

# Commits to skip:
‚ùå Work-in-progress features
‚ùå Experimental code
‚ùå Debug commits  
‚ùå "WIP" or "temp" commits
‚ùå Breaking changes without migration path
```

### Cherry-Pick Commands

```bash
# Basic cherry-pick
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick without commit (review first)
git cherry-pick -n <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick range of commits
git cherry-pick <start-hash>^..<end-hash>

# Cherry-pick with custom commit message
git cherry-pick <commit-hash> --edit

# Handle conflicts during cherry-pick
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
# ... resolve conflicts ...
git add .
git cherry-pick --continue
```

## Integration with Semantic-Release

### How It Works

1. **Release branch merged to main** ‚Üí Triggers semantic-release workflow
2. **Semantic-release analyzes commits** ‚Üí Determines version bump (major/minor/patch)
3. **Automatic actions:**
   - Creates git tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
   - Generates changelog from commit messages  
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Comments on PRs/issues included in release
   - Triggers build/artifact workflows

### Commit Message Format (Important)

Use conventional commits for proper semantic-release detection:

```bash
feat: add user authentication system       # Minor version bump
fix: resolve login timeout issue          # Patch version bump  
perf: improve database query performance   # Major version bump
docs: update API documentation            # No version bump
chore: update dependencies                # No version bump

# Breaking changes (major version bump)
feat!: redesign authentication API
feat: new auth system

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication API completely redesigned
```

## Automation and Shortcuts

### Helpful Git Aliases

```bash
# Add to ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
    # Quick branch switching
    co = checkout
    sw = switch

    # Release workflow shortcuts
    release-start = "!f() { git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b release-v$1; }; f"
    release-clean = "!f() { git checkout main && git pull && git checkout develop && git merge main && git push; }; f"

    # Cherry-pick helpers
    cp = cherry-pick
    cpc = cherry-pick --continue
    cpa = cherry-pick --abort

    # Log helpers
    commits = log --oneline --graph --decorate
    release-commits = "!f() { git log develop --oneline --since='$1 days ago'; }; f"
```

### Release Checklist Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# release-checklist.sh

echo "üöÄ Release Checklist"
echo "1. ‚úÖ All features tested and ready?"
echo "2. ‚úÖ Documentation updated?"  
echo "3. ‚úÖ Breaking changes documented?"
echo "4. ‚úÖ Security review completed?"
echo "5. ‚úÖ Performance testing done?"
echo ""
echo "Ready to create release branch? (y/n)"
read -r response
if [[ $response == "y" ]]; then
    echo "üåü Creating release branch..."
    git checkout main && git pull
    echo "Enter version (e.g., 1.2.0):"
    read -r version
    git checkout -b "release-v$version"
    echo "‚ú® Release branch release-v$version created!"
    echo "Next steps:"
    echo "1. Cherry-pick commits: git cherry-pick <hash>"
    echo "2. Push branch: git push origin release-v$version"  
    echo "3. Create PR to main"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Cherry-pick conflicts:**

```bash
# When conflicts occur during cherry-pick
git status                    # See conflicted files
# ... resolve conflicts manually ...
git add .
git cherry-pick --continue   # Complete the cherry-pick
```

**Accidentally included wrong commit:**

```bash
# Remove last commit from release branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Or use interactive rebase to edit history
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

**Need to add forgotten commit:**

```bash
# Add more commits to existing release branch
git cherry-pick <additional-commit>
git push origin release-v1.2.0 --force-with-lease
```

**Semantic-release not triggering:**

```bash
# Verify workflow file
cat .github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml

# Check if push to main triggered workflow
# Go to Actions tab in GitHub repository
# Verify semantic-release job ran successfully
```

## Branch Protection Setup (Optional)

For additional safety, configure branch protection:

### Main Branch Protection

- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date  
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes (admins only)
- ‚úÖ Do not allow force pushes

### Develop Branch Protection (Optional)

- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Allow direct pushes (for fast iteration)
- ‚ùå Don't require PR reviews (for small teams)

## Summary

This git branch strategy provides:

- ‚úÖ **Controlled releases** - Choose exactly what goes into each release
- ‚úÖ **Quality assurance** - Approval gates and testing on release branches  
- ‚úÖ **Automation** - Semantic-release handles versioning and notifications
- ‚úÖ **Clean history** - Clear separation between development and production
- ‚úÖ **Team scalability** - Works for solo developers and larger teams
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility** - Easy to adapt for different project needs

The combination of cherry-picking for selective releases and semantic-release for automation creates an optimal workflow for maintaining high-quality software releases.
